# Real-Time-Traffic-Noise-Monitoring

## Project Overview

This project implements a real-time big data pipeline to monitor, analyze, and predict the impact of urban traffic noise on commuter stress. Using simulated IoT noise sensors placed on real road networks in Milwaukee, the system integrates streaming data processing, machine learning, and sentiment analysis to identify noisy areas, forecast future noise conditions, and recommend quieter travel routes. The overall system is designed as a modular and scalable architecture that demonstrates core big data concepts, including high-velocity data ingestion, real-time stream processing, predictive analytics, and spatial analysis.

The architecture follows a layered design. Synthetic noise data are generated by geo-aware sensors placed on real road segments extracted from OpenStreetMap. These data streams are ingested using Apache Kafka, which provides reliable and high-throughput message handling. Apache Spark Structured Streaming processes the incoming data in near real time, performing validation, enrichment, and rolling-window aggregation. Processed data are stored in PostgreSQL for structured analytical access. On top of this storage layer, multiple analytics services operate, including machine learning–based noise prediction, noise–sentiment correlation analysis, and stress zone detection. Finally, the system exposes results through REST APIs and interactive Streamlit dashboards, enabling user-facing visualization and quiet-route recommendations.

Key system capabilities include realistic noise sensor simulation aligned with real road geometry, continuous streaming through Kafka and Spark, rolling noise aggregation and spatial segmentation, Random Forest–based noise prediction, statistically validated noise–sentiment correlation analysis, and stress zone identification that combines predicted noise levels with inferred sentiment. Quiet-route recommendations are generated using both real-time and forecasted conditions. The system is implemented using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Structured Streaming, PostgreSQL, Python, scikit-learn, OSMnx/OpenStreetMap, Flask, Streamlit, and Docker. The underlying data model supports raw noise readings, aggregated statistics, route-level noise segments, sentiment scores, correlation results, noise predictions, stress zones, and route recommendations, enabling both real-time insights and historical analysis.
